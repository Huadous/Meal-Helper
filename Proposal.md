## Proposal

**DATA SOURCE**

Yelp Fusion(API Key)

**What I'm trying to do**

I would like to fetch the useful information for a keyword(business, category, location, etc) and base on this keyword to return a useful analysis, like, searching for a restaurant by a location and you can get average ratings and some of the useful feedbacks. 

Yelp Fusion provide three types of endpoints I can use. I will try to make my program offer different ways to fetch the information which the user need. what's more, I will use the information the user provided to search for related information and make different types of presentation to show the data.(Here I will provide as much as I can get)
