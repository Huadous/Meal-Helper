## Proposal



**DATA SOURCE**

Yelp Fusion(API Key) https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/get_started

Yelp by crawling and scraping https://www.yelp.com/



**How to use the data source**

1. **Using API key to get base information and do analysis(4 points)**

   Yelp Fusion provide different types of endpoints I can use. I will try to  fetch the information which relating to what users need. what's more, I will use the information the user provided to search for related information and make different types of presentation to show the data.

2. **Crawling and scraping multiple pages in Yelp to gain information related covid-19(8 points)**

   I can also provide some updated services caused by covid-19 for each service. For example, I will make a filter for a specific type of food to figure out which restaurant can offer, like outdoor seating,  delivery, takeout, etc. This information can't be reached by api directly. I may try to crawling and scraping to get what I need.

   

**What I'm trying to do**

A program that lets a user choose a city and see the average ratings for different restaurant types from Yelp as **plotly bar**. 

Then, you can choose a specific type of food, the program will present a useful statistical information about the covid-19 and specific store information presented in a **table** to help you decide where to go. The program will also provide a **plot of map** to facilitate you to choose a location closer to you.

Finally, you can choose one restaurant specifically, the program will offer you more details in **text**.
