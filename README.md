SI 507 001 WN 2021 Final Project
This program mainly uses the API provided by Yelp Fusion. The **API verification key** is also very easy to apply, please apply through this link: https://www.yelp.com/fusion. Sign up for an account and manage apps on the website which will contain an API Key. You need to create a file named `secrets.py` and copy this variable into the file `API_KEY = 'your_api_key'`.

The entire app is built within the **flask** framework, and the human-computer interaction is relatively simple. The main thing is to use the **three drop-down menus** to select the state, the city in state, and the available restaurant categories. After selecting the state and city, statistical information about different categories will be displayed. Then you can choose your favorite restaurant category based on them. At this time, the information of the restaurants in that category will be displayed in the form of a table, or you can click the **Map button** to display the location of the restaurants. In the table, you can click the **"Click here" button** to enter the detailed information page of the restaurant.
